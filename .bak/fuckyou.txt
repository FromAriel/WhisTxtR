• I identified why the tray app won’t start on your Win10 box: it tries to load a bunch of Win11-only API shims (ext-ms-win-* / WinRT DLLs) pulled in by
  wgpu/eframe, and the loader aborts before main. Dependencies shows NOT_FOUND for many, e.g.:

  - ext-ms-win-appmodel-deployment-l1-1-0.dll
  - ext-ms-win-core-winrt-remote-l1-1-0.dll
  - ext-ms-win32-subsystem-query-l1-1-0.dll
  - ext-ms-win-oobe-query-l1-1-0.dll
  - … (multiple ext-ms* / WinRT-related)

  IFZ doesn’t use wgpu/eframe, so it runs fine on the same machine.

  I tried forcing wgpu to GL (WGPU_BACKEND=gl) and rebuilding with CUDA 12.4; build succeeds, but the runtime still dies with 0xC0000139. The overlay
  remains the blocker.

  Most recent change: added env forcing WGPU_BACKEND=gl in main.rs but couldn’t finish removing eframe overlay. Rebuild now fails intermittently due to
  PATH/libclang issues; last successful build was with CUDA 12.4.

  To make it run on Win10, we need to drop the wgpu/eframe overlay entirely or replace it with a non-DX/WinRT overlay; otherwise we’ll keep hitting
  missing ext-ms DLLs.

  Status:

  - IFZ build/run: OK.
  - Tray build: OK (when env is consistent); run: fails pre-main due to missing WinRT/ext-ms DLLs.
  - Dependencies tool added at J:\whistxt\Dependencies_x64; logs show the missing modules listed above.
  - CUDA 12.4 environment cleaned; CUDA DLLs present.

  Next step: replace/remove the eframe/wgpu HUD to eliminate Win11-only dependencies.
